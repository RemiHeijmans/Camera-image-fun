## Fun Projects
This repository contains various fun projects that involve image and video processing, ASCII art generation, and more. Some files use the camera to take photos, others create ASCII art from images or the camera feed, and some manipulate the proportions and colors of images.

## How to Run
Each file runs separately. Simply run the main method of the desired file. For the ASCII art converters, you can hard-code different characters to achieve a better effect. The commented option is for a white background, while the current one is for a black background. In most files, you can change the hard-coded values for various parameters, such as the width and height of the resulting image.

## Project Descriptions
AsciiArtConverter
This project takes a picture and converts it to ASCII art.

## Camera
This project takes a picture using the camera.

## ImageGuessingGame
In this project, you have to download images yourself and add their paths to the code. The more images you add, the more fun the game becomes.

## ImageProcessor
This is the most extensive class in the repository. You need to download an image and run the main method, then paste the image path when prompted. This class offers a lot of options, so feel free to explore and experiment.

## ImageRGBExtractor
This project takes a picture and prints out the RGB values of each pixel.

## ImagetoASCIIConverter (100... & allpixels)
For these two files, you need to download an image and add its path to the code to make it work. They convert the image to ASCII art.

## VideoRecorder
This project records a short video.

## Detailed Instructions
AsciiArtConverter
This project takes an input image and converts it to ASCII art. You can hard-code different characters to improve the effect. The commented option is for a white background, while the current one is for a black background.

## Camera
This project uses the camera to take a picture.

## ImageGuessingGame
In this project, you have to download images and add their paths to the code. When running the game, it will display images progressively, starting from very low resolution and doubling in size until it reaches the original resolution. Type "next" to load another random image or "stop" to end the game.

## ImageProcessor
This is the most extensive class in the repository. You need to download an image and paste the path when prompted. It offers various options for image manipulation, including color filters, resizing, and more.

## ImageRGBExtractor
This project extracts the RGB values of each pixel in an image and prints them out.

## ImagetoASCIIConverter (100... & allpixels)
These files convert an image to ASCII art. You need to download an image and add its path to the code to make it work.

## RealTimeAsciiArt
this films ya and makes ascii art ot of it instantly. it isn't that good.

## RealTimeMotionDetection
This project detects motion in real-time video feed from the camera.

## RealTimeEdgeDetection
This project performs real-time edge detection on video feed from the camera.

## RealTimeColorFilterSwitcher
This project allows switching between different color filters and pixel sizes in real-time using the camera feed.

## VideoRecorder
This project records a short video using the camera.

Feel free to replace "path_to_image_1.jpg", "path_to_image_2.jpg", and "path_to_image_3.jpg" in the ImageGuessingGame class with actual paths to your images.
